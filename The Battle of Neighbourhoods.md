## Introduction



In this report, I would be discussing some business problems people might encounter when starting a new restaurant in Downtown Toronto. And after presenting the problem, I would try to give suggestion on how to solve those problems, as well as on the best venue to start the new restaurant considering there are lots of great stores in town already.

Toronto as one of the larges city in Canada have over 2.9 millions of population in the city. And according to the "Toronto Restaurant Guide" there are more than 8000 restaurant in the every corner of the downtown area. Therefore, a good venue would become crucial to determine whether or nor the restaurant will become a success or not.Since this restaurant would be consider as a fine dining, I would concentration on three district, where has high density of popultions and can be easy approached by TTC.
